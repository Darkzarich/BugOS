# BugOS
A university project which represents a simple and pretty limited OS made on C and NASM. Basically, allows only drawing and save drawn pictures on ROM itself.

File compile lvl two.exe is specially written compiler to make a ROM out of all files in directory such as pictures of interface and load screen, nasm pre-load instructions, C combined with NASM functions. 

To run this you need to have installed QEMU and then run start.bat. Teoretically will also work if you put mbr.o on flashdrive and try to use it as boot device.
